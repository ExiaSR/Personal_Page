This robot is a crawling snake and it is completely autonomous. It can be used for search and rescued missions. We believe that this can also be used for exploration on Mars. This robot has a camera attached to the head which sends the video stream to an android phone. The phone will be used for computer vision calculations. Snakebot is powered by an Arduino and some inertia measurement units(imu). This project is completely open source, we release all of our code and design files on github.

I gain a sense of unity from working with members, without our teamwork, we won't be able to accomplish what we have done. I really enjoy working as a part of the team, it not only promot a sense of achivement, but also encourage myself to work harder and learn more.

This project is developed by Robot Club at Guangya School in 2015.
