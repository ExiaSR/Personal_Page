Since May 1, a wildfire began in Fort Mcmurray, a city which is around 400km from the place I live in. It destroyed most building, and forcing the resident leaving their hometown.

My school, the Univercity of Alberta has taken action by providing the campus resident, Lister Center, as an evacuee center for all Fort Mcmurray residents.

I just happen to stay at Lister Center during the Spring, so I decided to voluntter half my weekend to help and assist evacuees. Yesterday, I've been working with the dinning service at Lister Center, distributing food, and offering help whenever evacuess ask for. Though my effort is not as big as those who are working at the front line, I'm just trying to do my best to help people, that's the least thing I can do.
